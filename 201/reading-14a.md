# CSS Transforms

## Transforms

  *Transform* - is a property that comes in two different settings, two-dimensional and three-dimensional. Each of these come with their own individual properties and values.

  **Transform Syntax**
    The actual syntax for the transform property is quite simple, inluding the transform property followed by the value. The value specifies the transform type follwed by a specific amount inside parentheses. 

      div {
        -webkit-transform: scale(1.5);
          -moz-transform: scale(1.5);
            -o-transform: scale(1.5);
              transform: scale(1.5);
      }
