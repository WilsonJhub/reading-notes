# Understanding Structure
    - Structure in HTML is a fundamentally organized standard for all HTML text. 
     - The structure for HTML will consist of the following:
     <html>
            <head> (contains information **about** the page.)
                <title> This is the title. </title>
            </head>
            <body> (shown inside the main browser.)
                <h1> This is your main heading.</h1>
                <p> This is your paragraph.</p>
                <h2> This is your sub-heading.</h2>
                <p> This is another paragraph.</p>
        </body> 
      <html>  
In the example above, you will notice some words/letters inside of curled brackets. These are called *"tags"* or *"elements"*

## HTML 5 Layout

    - HTML 5 is an alternative structure available for use. It offers a set of elments that give the developer ability to divide their webpage depending on content they wish to use. There are many added benefits to this structure. It also makes the code much easier to follow.

# The ABC of Programming

What is a Script?
 - A scrtipt is a series of isntructions that a computer can follow to achieve a goal. For example, *Script* is to Computer like a *Recipe* is to food. 

 Before writing a script, the developer must have a clear goal in mind. Make note of what tasks need to be completed in order to complete said goal. Computers have the ability to complete tasks, just like humans do. The only difference is that computers lack the ability to think for themselves. Meanin, computers must always be told what and how to accomplish their goals. So if a developer inputs a script that contains a defect, that goal will not get completed until that flaw is removed.
