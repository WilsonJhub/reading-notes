# The History of Local Storage for Web Applications

*userData* and *DHTML Behaviors* were incorporated into *Internet Explorer* and used to end the "First Great Browser Wars"

  * userData: Allows web pages to store up to 64KB of data per domain, in a hierarchical XML-based structure.
  * DHTML Beaviors: Components that encapsulate specific functionality or behavior on a page. When applied to a standard HTML element on a page, 
    a behavior enhances that elements's default behavior.

## Introducing HTML 5 Storage

  * HTML5 storage: a specification named *Web Storage*. A way for web pages to store named key/value pairs locally, within the client web browser. 
The latest version of pretty much every browser supports HTML5 storage. However, before using HTML5 storage, you should check to see if the browser supports.
