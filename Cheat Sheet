### **Text Editor**
When deciding on which text you would like to use, you need to first identify what you will be using it for.  
Many default text editors that come with a standard PC will only contain standard text features.

## Choosing your Text Editor
Some of your text editors are operating system specific. So maake sure that you pay attention to the available options.  
For example, **Text Wrangler** is for MAC OS only. As opposed ot **Visual Studio Code**, which is available for MAC, Windows, and Linux.  
Another great factor is the price of the software being purchased. Your text editor can range anywhere from $40 - $70. Some software will provide you  
with a 30-day trial.
