## Growth Mindset

### Developing a growth mindset means that the major key to your better future is ***YOU***.

You must hold yourself accountable and truly understand that you can achieve any goal that you set out to achieve.  

- Remember, there are no losses. Only ***LESSONS***!
- Taking mental breaks!
- Life is like a Sine wave. There are ups and there are downs. If you are on the down wave, then you can assume that you are getting closer to the top.
