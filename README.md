## Growth Mindset

### Developing a growth mindset means that the major key to your better future is ***YOU***.

*Hold yourself accountable and truly understand that you can grasp any goal that your mind sets out to achieve*.  

- Remember, there are no losses. Only ***LESSONS***!
- Taking mental breaks!
- Reward yourself after accomplishing any goal.
- Life is like a Sine wave. There are ups and there are downs. If you are on the down wave, perservere. Nature has a way of rewarding those with patience.
