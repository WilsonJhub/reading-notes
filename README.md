## Growth Mindset
Life is the continuation of expansion and contraction.  
Learn to love the contraciton as much as the ***EXPANSION***  

### Developing a growth mindset means that the major key to your better future is ***YOU***.

*Hold yourself accountable and truly understand that you can grasp any goal that your mind sets out to achieve*.  

#### Thoughts for Success
- Remember, there are no losses. Only ***LESSONS***!
- Reward yourself after accomplishing any goal.
- Life is like a Sine wave. There are ups and there are downs. If you are on the down wave, *perservere*. Nature has a way of rewarding those with patience. 
- Be like a tree and grow as high as you can!
