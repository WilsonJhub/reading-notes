# Operators

### Operators
    - Assignment operators
    - Comparison operators
    - Arithmetic operators
    - Bitwise operators
    - Logical operators
    - String operators
    - Conditional (ternary) operator
    - Comma operator
    - Unary operators
    - Relational operators

## Comparison Operator
 - *A comparison operator compares its operands and returns a logical  
 value based on whether the comparison is true.*
    Example:
            -   var var1 = 3;
                var var2 = 4;

## Assignment Operator
    - *An assignment operator assigns a value to its left operand based on the value of its right operand. The simple assignment operand is equal (=) which assigns the value of its right operand to it s left operand. That is, x = f() is an assignment expression that assigns the value of f() to x.*

# Loops and Iteration
    #### *Loops offer a quick and easy way to something repeatedly. 

## For Statement
    - A *for* loop repeats until a specified condition evaluates to false. The JavaScript for loop is similar to the Java and C for loop.*
        Example: 
         - for ([initialExpression]; [conditionExpression]; [incrementExpression]) statement
        
## Do...While Statement
    - statement is always executed once before the condition is checked. (To execute multiple statements, use a block statement ({ ... }) to group those statements.)
        Example: 
            - *do 
                statement
              while(condition);*
