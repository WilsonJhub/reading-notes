### What is Inheritance?
    - Inheritance allows the ability to *inherit* commonly used state and behavior from other classes.  
        Ex: Mountain bikes, road bikes, and tandem bikes all share characteristics of bicycle (current speed, current  
            pedal cadence, current gear)
    
### What is Interface?
    - Interface Methods form the object's interface with the outside world; the buttons on the front of your television  
    set, for example, are the interface between you and the electrical wiring on the other side of its plastic casing  

### What Is a Package?
    - A package is a namespace that oganizes a set of related classes and interfaces. 
        Ex: Different folders on a computer.
