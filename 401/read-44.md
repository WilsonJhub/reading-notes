## Ethics in Tech

### Google AI and Weapons/Surveillance

Google was a part of a project called Project Maven. Project Maven is the Department of Defense's most visible artificial intelligence  
tool, designed to process imagery and full-motion video from drones and automatically detect potential targets. Google employees were not  
happy about the googles involvement with the project because it promoted offensive violence. Eventually Google's CEO decided to not partake in 
any other future projects promoting violence with the Department of defense. Google employees ethics were challenged here. They had the decision to 
either keep quiet or voice their opinions. This kind of ethical dilemma stretches the moral boundaries of anyone. I agree with Google CEO, Sundar Pichai.
I don't think that AI vision recognition should participate in offensive military tactics. However, I would not be opposed to creating AI systems that are explicitly 
created in preparation for any potential foreign invasions.
