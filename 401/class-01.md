# Java Basics
--- -
These fundamentals to Java language are important because these terms and definitions will aid in the  growth and  
understanding of future java programming concepts. It is vital to have a basic grasp of fundamentals when discussing any  
programming language. 

## Variables:

    There are four kinds of variables in Java language: 

    - Instance Variables: Are variables that are 'non-static', meaning the variable is unique to its  
    class. Ex: the currentSpeed of one bicycle is independent from the currentSpeed of another.

    - Class Variables (Static Fields): Any field declared with the 'static' modifier. This signifies that there is  
    exactly ONE copy of this varaible in existence. 

    - Local Variables:  Methods will use local variables to temporarily store its states. The determination of a 'local'  
    variable is entirely dependent on where the variable is declared. Local variables are only visible to the methods in  
    which they are declared; they are not accessable from the rest of th class.

    - Parameters: Looking at 'public static void main(String[] args) <-- args is the parameter. 

## Operators:

    - Operators are special symbols that perom specific operations on one, two, or three operands, and then return a  
    result.

## Expression, Statements, and Blocks:  
Source:[Java Expressions, Statements, and Blocks](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/expressions.html)  

    Expression: An expression is a construct made up of variables, operators, and method invocations,  
    which are constructed according to the syntax of the language, that evaluates to a single value.
    
    Statements:  A statement forms a complete unit of execution.  
    
    Blocks: A block is a group of zero or more statements between balanced braces and can be used  
    anywhere a single statement is allowed.

## Control Flow Statements:  
Source:  [Java Control Flow Statements](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/flow.html)

    Control flow statements break up the flow of execution by employing decision making, looping,  
    and branching, enabling your program to conditionally execute particular blocks of code.
