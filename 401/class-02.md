# Java Imports and Loops  
-- -

## ***Imports*** are important because they allow the developer to understand what is being used within a project.  
## ***Loops*** are important to programming because it gives the developer the ability to shorten their lines of code.  

### Imports:   
*Source:* [Java Imports](https://exlskills.com/learn-en/courses/java-basics-basics_java/introduction-to-java-EjbGqwITMHcf/java-class-and-source-file-fEPKFXKZHXBh/imports-wjwLIaSkSiMg)  

    What are they?
        - Imports give Java the advantage of pre-built classes and methods that can perform many functions such as  
        reading a content file or comparing different dates. The classes are organized into packages that must be  
        imported into a project in order to be used. Imports will almost always be located at the top of the files code.  

### Loops:  
*Source:* [Java Loops](https://www.baeldung.com/java-loops)  

    What are they?  
        - Loops are a feature that facilitates the execution of a set of instructions until the controlling  
        boolean-expression evaluate to false.   
        
    Type of Loops:  
        - for loop:  A for loop is a control structure that allows us to repeat certain operations by incrementing  
        and evaluating a loop counter.  

        - for-each loop: for-each loop is a shortcut version of for-loop which skips the need to get the iterator and  
        loop over iterator using it's hasNext() and next() method.  

        - While loop:  The while loop is Java's most fundamental loop statement. It repeats a statement or a block of  
        statements while its controlling Boolean-expression is true

        - Do-While loop: The do-while loop works just like the while loop except for the fact that the first condition 
        evaluation happens after the first iteration of the loop.
