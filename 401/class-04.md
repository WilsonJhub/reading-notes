## Object-Oriented Programming Concepts  

    Object:
        - An object is a software bundle of related state and behavior. Software objects are often used to model the real-world objects that you 
          find in everyday life.

    Objects are fundamental to object oriented programming. They hold states and behaviors just the same   
    as every object in the real world. Objects store their states in to *fields* and then expose its behavior(verb/action)  
    through *methods*(functions in programming language)


    Class:  
        - A class is a blueprint or prototype from which objects are created.

    In the real world, we have blueprints of how a specific object is created. Instead of having to reinvent    
    the wheel, we use the same structure to ensure that our wheel will work. BUT we have MANY different wheels, 
    like a snow tire, off roading tire, etc. These wheels work essentially the same with added properties that 
    give it its uniqueness. This is what a class is. So in object-oriented terms, we say that our (snow) wheel 
    is an instance of the class of objects known as wheel.
