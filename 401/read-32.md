## What is Serverless

`Serverless is a cloud computing execution model where the cloud provider dynamically manages the allocation and provisioning of servers.`  

    Note: A serverless application runs in stateless compute  
    containers that are event-triggered, ephemeral(may last for noe invocation), and fully managed by the cloud provider.
