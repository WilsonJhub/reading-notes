### Hash table

`A hash table is a datastructure that maps keys to values. It is part of a technique called hashing, the other of which is a hash function. A hash function is an algorithm that produces an index of where a value can be found or stored in the hash table.`  

### Implementation of a Hash Table  

    - The basic idea behind hash is to distribute key/value pairs across an array of placeholders or "buckets" in the hash table. 

`Note: A hash table is typically an array of linked lists. When you want to insert a key/value pair, you first need to use the hash function to map the key to an index in the hash table. Given a key, the hash function can suggest an index where the value can be found or stored.`
