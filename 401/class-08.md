## Rule of Three
    This rule states that when you have 3 peices of code that are similar, then it should be extracted into  
    a new procedure. Refactor it.

### You aren't gonna need it
    It is a bad habit to add any functionality until you are actually going to need it.  
    "Always implement things when you actually need them, never when you just foresee that you need them.  
        - Ron Jeffries (co-founder of XP)

### Minimum Viable Product
    This is when you have produced enough usable features and functionality to the user that can result in  
    further development and feedback from the user.
