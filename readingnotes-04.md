## Links (pg. 77)

Links are created using the <a> element. Users can click on anything between the opening `<a>` and the closing `</a>` tag. You specify which page you want to link to by using the (href) attribute. 
     
     Ex:   
           `<a href="http://www.imdb.com">IMDB`</a>`
  The text between the `<a>` tag and the closing `</a> tag is know as link text. This should tell the visitor where they will be taken to. 
  

## Layout(pg.361)

CSS treats each HTML elements as if it is in its own box. This box will either be a block-level box or an inline box.  
  * Block-Level Boxes: start on a new line and act as the main building blocks of any layout.  
  * Inline Boxes: Flow between surrounding text.    

CSS has 3 position schemes that allow you to control the layout of the page.  
  
    *Normal Flow:  Every block-level element appears on a new line, causing each item to appear 
                   lower down the page than the previous one. Even if you specify the width of the boxes and  
                   there is enough space for two elements to sit side-by-side, 
                   they will not appear next to each other unless you tell it otherwise.
