# Lists 
### There are three classifications of HTML lists. 
    - Ordered: created with the < ol> element.   
    - Unordered: created with the < ul> element.  
    - Definition: created with the < dl> element.  
    
In order to list these items you will need to utilize the < li> Element. This tells the wepage to "list" out the content. 
  Example:
    
    < ol>
       < li> enter content here. < /li>
       < li> enter content here. < /li>
       < li> enter content here. < /li>
    </ ol>
